    <h2>I like to make stuff</h2>
</div>


    <p>I want to be a Software Engineer as I enjoy the responsibilities and tasks accompanied with it</p>
    <p>I'm not 100% sure as to what aspect specifically of software engineering I want to deal  with but I know I'll do it well</p><br>

    <h1 id="interest">/short lived interests</h1>
    <h2>I have done quite a few things.</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>I <a> drew</a> things... </ul>
        <ul>I picked up video editing in 8th grade, considering I did it for about 2 years it really shouldn't be on the list.(I wasn't very good)</ul>
        <ul>I dabbled in photoshop.</ul>
        <ul>I tried out digital art, this would be my last short lived interest</ul>
    </li><br>

    <h1 id="backstory">/how i got into programming</h1>
    <p>I actually started out "programming" because of my classmate, Raul, he did something to the school computer
     in an 8th grade Information Technology class and i found it interesting. As a result, I went home and googled "how to code" and came 
     across a site that showed me how to do html, that interest didn't last long though. However I picked it back up two years later and branched into 
     real programming languages like python. </p><br>

    <h1 id='bye'>/bye bye</h1>
    <p>I was bored so that's why I made this, I may fix this up some more or I may not, who knows... I have exams this year so I definetly don't :)</p>
