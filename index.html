    <div id='back'><p >I actually started out "programming" because of my classmate, Raul, he did something to the school computer

     in an 8th grade Information Technology class and i found it interesting. As a result, I went home and googled "how to code" and came 
     across a site that showed me how to do html, that interest didn't last long though. However I picked it back up two years later and branched into 
     real programming languages like python. </p><div><br>
